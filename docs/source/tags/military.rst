Network design with redundancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description: Design of an electricity transportation network provides enough redundancy, so that a break of one component does not prevent any user from receiving electricity. The approach also works for similar distribution networks and can potentially be used in the design of military logistic networks.
